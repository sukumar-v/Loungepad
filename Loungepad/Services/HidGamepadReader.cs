       the same one the Linux hid-playstation driver reads. Over USB the pad sends it by default

       something reads its calibration feature report, after which it switches to the full 0x31 --
       the same body at a different offset, with a CRC on the end. Steam does exactly that read,
       and it used to leave the pad unreadable here; now it is what we ask for ourselves.
