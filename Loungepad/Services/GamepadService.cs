/// Background gamepad polling loop (~125 Hz).
///
/// Two sources, one loop. Xbox pads come from XInput; everything else -- a DualSense, a Switch
/// Pro controller, a generic HID pad -- comes from HidGamepadReader, already translated into
/// XInput's shape. Whichever pad moved most recently is the one driving, and its family
/// ("xbox", "playstation", "switch", "generic") is published so the UI can draw the right
/// glyphs next to "Select".
///
/// Two roles:
///  • UI navigation — when the launcher window is foreground, D-pad and face buttons are
///    delivered as events to the web UI (A=accept, B=back, X/Y/MENU per the on-screen legend).
///  • Gamepad-mouse — the left stick always moves the Windows cursor (deadzone + power
///    acceleration curve); the configured buttons send real left/right clicks whenever the
///    launcher is NOT foreground (e.g. the user tabbed to the desktop). While a game runs the
///    whole service idles unless GamepadMouseDuringGame is enabled, so games with native
///    controller support never see phantom mouse input.
