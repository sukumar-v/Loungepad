/*
 * Loungepad metadata proxy.
 *
 * Holds the IGDB and SteamGridDB credentials so the launcher does not have to. This is the same
 * shape Playnite uses -- its IGDB plugin ships no keys and talks to api2.playnite.link -- and it
 * exists for the same reason: a desktop binary cannot keep a secret, and Twitch's terms say the
 * client secret must never be exposed to users.
 *
 * Three endpoints, all GET:
 *
 *   /v1/facts?title=<title>   description, developer, genres, release date, critic score
 *   /v1/art?title=<title>     portrait / tile / hero / logo image URLs
 *   /v1/owned?steamid=<id>    the games a Steam account owns, for the uninstalled half of a
 *                             library -- the one route that is not cached, see ownedGames
 *   /v1/achievements?steamid=<id>&appid=<id>
 *                             one game's achievements for one account: the schema, the account's
 *                             unlocks and the global rarity, in one answer; see steamAchievements
 *
 * The first two may answer 404, which means "no confident answer", not "something broke". The
 * launcher treats a 404 and a network failure identically: it keeps whatever art it already had.
 *
 * The cache is the whole economy of this service. IGDB allows 4 requests a second across the
 * entire credential -- not per user -- so an uncached proxy would fall over the moment more than
 * a handful of people scanned at once. Game metadata is effectively static and libraries overlap
 * enormously (everyone owns Hollow Knight), so a shared cache turns thousands of users into a few
 * thousand upstream requests, once, ever.
